# Happy Home Family Organizer

This project was built with ReactJS frontend and Python Flask API. 

# About the app

Happy Home Family Organizer is an app that allows your whole family to organize their collective calendar and track their own to-do lists and chores lists. Each family has one collective login which then allows the user to add a new family member to the app or choose from an existing family member. 


# Features

## CALENDAR

The Calendar functionality was built utilizing the React Full Calendar component, which is featured on the logged in user’s homepage and the Calendar page. The homepage allows you to view a snapshot of scheduled events on a weekly basis. The Calendar page allows you to add events to the calendar, view by day, week or month and it allows you to delete events that were previously added to the calendar. 

## LISTS

The lists page allows users to add to-dos or chores that need to be tracked and completed. The lists allow you to mark chores or to-dos as completed or completely delete them from the database. The lists are also highlighted on the logged in user’s homepage allowing you to take a quick look at what you have on your lists.

## PROFILE

The profile page allows users to view the logged in user’s information along with the current member accessing the app. This page allows you to delete the current family member from the app, giving you a pop-up warning before you delete the family member.
